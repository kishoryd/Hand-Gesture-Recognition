# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
The gesture to text system uses a deep learning model to recognize and classify different hand gestures based on input from a web camera. The system is designed to translate these gestures into written language in real-time, making it easier for people with hearing impairments to communicate with others who do not understand sign language.
